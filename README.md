# PlantinoCare
Developed in occasion of the Arduino Day 2023, the project aims to assist in plant management while promoting water conservation, which has become crucial in recent years. 

Using a microcontroller and various sensors, we collect data from the plant and the surrounding environment, the data is then displayed in an application accessible from smartphones and computers, allowing remote data control. 

The application provides instructions to improve plant conditions. It is also possible to automate actions such as watering and control light exposure.
